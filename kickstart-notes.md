## How is GPU offloading done in julia?

- Implemented using [`CUDA.jl`](https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/) which wraps (?) `CUDA`-libraries to make them available in julia and easy to use.


## Diagonalization

### CPU

- Using the base implementation from `LinearAlgebra`


### GPU

- `CUDA.CUSOLVER.heevjBatched!` is **H**ermitian Matrix **J**acobi based **E**igen **V**alue **D**ecomposition which originates from the `CUSOLVER` library [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolver/index.html#cusolverdn-t-syevjbatched)

> [!CAUTION]
> What is batching over an index?

>[!CAUTION]
> What does an expression of the type `CUDA.@sync` mean in front of a variable (syntactically in general)?



## Questions

**1.** Would it be less bad coding practice if the function tells us that it mutates
    it's arguments?

~~~julia
function diag_dynmats(dynmats) 
    eigen(dynmats)
    return 1
end
~~~
